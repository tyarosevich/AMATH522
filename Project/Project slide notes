So the model:

(1) Uses the SEIR model as a system of ODEs that will be optimized over to ascertain the parameters.

(2) Talk about the parameters, how Beta is determined, which ones are assumed and why.

(3) How the paper uses the optimization function call to get the parameters.

(4) Then time steps the dD and dC functions to model a fit to the current data.

(5) So why this convoluted path? Why optimize over the SEIR model to get the parameters and then time step the C and D functions? Why is the B(t) function a decaying exponential.
